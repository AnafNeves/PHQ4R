## Project Description

This project takes the form of an online survey containing various questionnaires present in random order. Its main objective is to validate a modification of the PHQ-4 depression and anxiety questionnaire (Lowe et al., 2010), by testing the benefits of adding a new response option in the Likert scale in improving the questionnaire's sensitivity to mood fluctuations in the general (non-clinical) population. 

This will be investigated by testing whether the correlation with established measures of depression and anxiety (BDI and STAI) is higher with the modified PHQ-4 as compared to the original version. The survey will also include questionnaires related to emotional and bodily awareness. 

The survey, delivered online, will include the following parts:
1) Study information and consent form. See ethical considerations section below. 
2) Standard demographic questions (age, gender, education level, etc.)
3) Mood difficulties antecedents: participants will be invited (but it will be explicitly marked as non-required) to tick from a list of issues if they have been diagnosed with any of them and if they are currently undergoing medical treatment related to them. 

4) Then participants will then be invited to answer all four questionnaires in random order:

- PHQ-4 (randomly assigned to be either the original or the modified version): The modified version simply adds a new response item - 'once or twice' - in between 'not at all' and 'several days' in the Likert scale. 
- BDI-II (Beck, et al., 1996): self-report 21 item questionnaire with strong validity and reliability to measure depression. 
- STAI-5 (Zsido, 2020): This 5-items questionnaires measures anxiety. Changes will be made in the instructions from asking "how participants feel right now" to "over the past 2 weeks" to keep it consistent with the instructions of the PHQ-4 and BDI-II. 
- IAS (Murphy et al., 2019): This questionnaire assesses interoceptive accuracy.

5) Finally, debriefing information will be provided, and participants will be be given a final opportunity to withdraw their participation.

The key ethical issue is the nature of some of the questions used, as they ask people to reflect and acknowledge their feelings and state of mind. Some people might find completing these types of questionnaires to cause them distress and negative emotions. If participants find the questionnaires distressing, they are invited to stop the study at any time without giving a reason. If they find that completing the questionnaire raises any concerns for them about their current levels of anxiety or depression, they are suggested to make an appointment with their GP to discuss strategies to help them manage, as well as discussing further sources of support. If they are a student at the University of Sussex, they are also suggested to contact the student life centre for counselling services and advice via email: studentcentre@sussex.ac.uk, phone: +441273075700 or via their website: https://student.sussex.ac.uk/centre/. Otherwise, they can also seek helpful information about depression and anxiety on the NHS choices website: https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/feelings-and-symptoms/

## Section A

- A.1-10: No

## Section B

- B.1: Given the correlation nature of the study, we hope to collect a minimum of 50 participants per condition (100 in total).
- B.2: Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect). As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria.
- B.3: The study is composed of a series of questionnaires.
- B.4: Participants will be able to partake in the study online. However, we encourage participants to complete it in a quiet place with as little distraction as possible.
- B.5: The study asks participants some personal questions about their feelings, personality and current state of mind, which might trigger negative feelings. Therefore, we give the participants an opportunity to quit the questionnaire at any time throughout the experiment. We also provide information about counselling and support services in both the study information sheet and the debrief sheet. Participant's data anonymity will be entirely ensured.
