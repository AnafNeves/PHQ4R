# PHQ-4-R

This is an adaptation of the PHQ-4 questionnaire to increase its sensitivity to subclinical variability.

## About the PHQ-4

The original Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) was developed and validated by Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & Löwe, (2009). Its purpose is to allow for ultra brief and accurate measurement of core symptoms/signs of depression and anxiety.

It consists of two validated ultra-brief screeners for depression (PHQ–2) and anxiety (GAD–2). Each of the items corresponds to the DSM-IV Diagnostic Criterion A symptoms for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, respectively.

### Items

Over the **last 2 weeks**, how often have you been bothered by the following problems?

- **Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge**
- **Not being able to stop or control worrying**
- **Little interest or pleasure in doing things**
- **Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless**

The traditional 4 response options are:

- 0: "Not at all"
- 1: "Several days"
- 2: "More than half the days"
- 3: "Nearly every day"

Total score is determined by adding together the scores of each of the four items. Scores are rated as normal (0-2), mild (3-5), moderate (6-8), and severe (9-12). Total score >= 3 for first 2 questions suggests possible anxiety. Total score >= 3 for last 2 questions suggests possible depression. 


## Modifications for the Subclinical version

In order to better capture potential mild mood inflections without altering the scale scoring or structure, we added the **"Once or twice"** option in between not at all and several (see [Dobson et al., 1979](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.1979.49.2.575) for the choice of the label). The new response scale is:

- 0: "Not at all"
- 0.5: "Once or twice"
- 1: "Several days"
- 2: "More than half the days"
- 3: "Nearly every day"
